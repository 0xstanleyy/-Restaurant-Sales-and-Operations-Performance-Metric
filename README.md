# Restaurant Sales and Operations Performance Metric
A Power BI Deep Dive on Sales Performance

# Overview
This report analyzes sales performance, profitability, and operational trends to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency. Data in this report are not based on any real restaurants and was used as a learning experience

# Problem Statement
Key challenges faced include:

* The $38.40 Average Order Value (AOV) is low and needs improvement through upselling.
* The Brie Carre Pizza is a significant product failure, contributing the least to all sales metrics.
* Total orders drop dramatically mid-year, indicating a lack of consistent sales across all months.
* Sales are highly concentrated on Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings, suggesting a need to boost sales on other days.
* High reliance on Classic category and Large size pizzas requires diversifying the product mix to other categories.

# Tools and Methodology
  Tools:
* Power BI: Dashboard creation and visualization.
* DAX: Calculated measures for metrics like profit and return rate.
* Power Query: Data cleaning and preliminary analysis.

# Method:
Data Cleaning: I carried out major cleaning steps like standardization, removing duplicates, and ensuring accuracy in the provided dataset. I also ensured a backup documentation of cleaning steps.
Data Processing: With Power Bi's Dax functionalities, I created calculated measures to show valuable metrics, customized and design visuals to aid clarity in understanding trends.
Data Visualization: Built a two page interactive dashboards that answers stakeholders questions in detail.

# Key Analysis and Findings
 Performance and Product Popularity
* Average Order Value (AOV) is Low: The AOV of $38.40 is a key metric showing the average money spent per transaction. This suggests there is a significant          opportunity for the business to implement effective upselling and cross-selling strategies (e.g., adding drinks or sides) to increase the value of each order.
* Dominant Size and Category: The Large size is the most popular, and the Classic category contributes the most to overall revenue and quantity sold. This           concentration indicates a strong preference but also a risk if demand for that specific product mix changes.
* Clear Worst Seller: The Brie Carre Pizza is a major underperformer, ranking last across revenue, quantity, and total orders. This signals a product that should    be reviewed for potential removal, recipe/price change, or targeted marketing to improve its dismal sales.
* Top Sellers by Metric: The top products are split: The Thai Chicken Pizza leads by Revenue, while The Classic Deluxe Pizza leads by Quantity. This shows that      the Thai Chicken Pizza is a high-value item, whereas the Classic Deluxe is a high-volume item.
# Sales Trends and Customer Behavior
* Weekly Peak Times: Sales are heavily concentrated on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, suggesting the business is strongly focused on the weekend/end-of-week        rush. This highlights an opportunity to create incentives or special promotions to boost sales on slower days like Monday and Tuesday.
* Volatile Monthly Demand: The monthly trend chart shows significant volatility, with the highest orders in January and April and a sharp drop in June (the lowest   month). This requires investigation into seasonal factors or competitor activity to stabilize sales flow throughout the year.
* Peak Ordering Hours: While not explicitly charted by hour, the daily trend indicates a clear evening rush on those peak days, making resource and staffing         optimization critical during those windows.

# Recommendations
* Increase the low $38.40 Average Order Value by actively promoting combo meals and side orders during checkout.
* Use the established peak days (Thursday-Saturday) and peak hours (evening) to run highly localized digital ads (geo-fencing) offering immediate order              incentives, while simultaneously testing "early bird" specials on Monday-Wednesday to shift some demand to less busy times.
* Discontinue the poorly performing Brie Carre Pizza to simplify inventory and focus resources on top sellers like The Thai Chicken Pizza.

# Conclusion
The Pizza Sales Report clearly establishes that the business has strong baseline demand, particularly for Large and Classic pizzas, generating a significant portion of its revenue, but critical challenges related to profitability and stability must be addressed. The low Average Order Value (AOV) of $38.40 indicates a failure to effectively upsell, while the poor performance of products like The Brie Carre Pizza is a drag on resources; moreover, the severe fluctuations in sales volume both monthly (e.g., the June slump) and daily (peak on Thursdays-Saturdays) demonstrate a substantial missed opportunity to fully utilize capacity and generate consistent revenue throughout the entire week and year, necessitating immediate strategic interventions to boost transaction size, refine the menu, and stabilize demand through targeted promotions.
